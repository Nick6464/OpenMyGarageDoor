# OpenMyGarageDoor

### The Idea:
We want to be able to open our garage door with a Web app because the remote is lame.
We also want the Web app to be built with adequate security posture so that the car won't get stolen.

## The Frontend:
The frontend is going to be built from React with TypeScript and uitilise MUI components.


## The Backend:
The backend is going to be built with Node.js that runs on a server.


## The Pi Backend:
The Pi-end is going to run Flask.
